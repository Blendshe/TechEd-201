 ### Objects in js   
An object is the most powerful in js   
js is an object orientated language, everything is an object   
An array is a type of object   
Object is what js sees - humans, laptop - everything is an object   

There are 5 datatypes in js   
1. numeric - 1, 2, 3 etc
2. String - "sdhrthaighaei"
3. Object - Boolean
4. Function data type
5. Object - [ ] { }   

Html is a document in js   

var jez = 1.2e111=number   
e is a number - 10 to the power of 1 e.g. 1.2e1 = 12   

#### Document Object Model - DOM  
Things need to be in the right order, head is for external data SEO etc. other things - script, style   
Body is for actual code, html in body   
Sequencing is important for browser to understand    
js is the only language the browser understands    

DOM is how js existis in its mind   
Hierarchial structure   
Hierarchial tree   
is called parsing    

DOM tree is js language, it will translate into its own language   

DOM is the entire webpage, a model, schema, structure in a sequence   

**DOM manipulation** js can change the inner content of an object, so `<p>' below would change to some content   

`<p>some content</p>`   

`<h1> <p> and <div> are children of the body`   

`<div> <h1> </h1> </div> so here <h1></h1> is inside the <div></div>`   

**innertext** will give you everything in a string, getting raw data not html   

**innerhtml gets you html and text
