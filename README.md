 *CLASS 6 DOM 21.02.23*  
  
#### Document Object Model - DOM  
Things need to be in the right order, head is for external data SEO etc. other things - script, style   
Body is for actual code, html in body   
Sequencing is important for browser to understand    
js is the only language the browser understands    

DOM is how js existis in its mind   
Hierarchial structure   
Hierarchial tree   
is called parsing    

DOM tree is js language, it will translate into its own language   

DOM is the entire webpage, a model, schema, structure in a sequence   

**DOM manipulation** js can change the inner content of an object, so `<p>` below would change to some content   

`<p>some content</p>`   

`<h1> <p> and <div> are children of the body`   

`<div> <h1> </h1> </div> so here <h1></h1> is inside the <div></div>`  
  
    
    
![screenshot of DOM diagram](/DOM%20V%20Image%20210223.png)  
  
**innertext** will give you everything in a string, getting raw data not html   

**innerhtml** gets you html and text     

See Carlas code in Discord at 19.49pm   
innertext and innerhtml also what V posted diagram of DOM tree **get this here** in this README   
<img src="C:\Users\Jane G\Documents\TechEducators\201-Project\201-Project-images">
You can get the info e.g. getElementByid and can js can change the html and also the css   

##### DOM manipulation   
  
text and string are the same thing    
can create elements understood by the browser that already exist but can't invent new ones e.g.    
  
`document.createElement("p")`

**Task - build 'Salmon Cookies' website and check Discord 230323**    
  
  
*Class 8 27.02.23*  
  
 ### Objects in js - object is the god particle  
An object is the most powerful in js   
js is an object orientated language, everything is an object   
An array is a type of object   
Object is what js sees - humans, laptop - everything is an object   

There are 5 datatypes in js   
1. numeric - 1, 2, 3 etc
2. String - "sdhrthaighaei"
3. Object - Boolean
4. Function data type
5. Object - [ ] { }   

Html is a document in js   

Objects include data and functions   
Array [ ] a group of similar data types is an object   
You can have an array inside an object  
You can have different things inside an object   
  **see screenshot 2 for this class**   
 
 **see code in Discord for this class Inspector Gadget coding**
  
To access whats in the object e.g.   
`avengers.fav-characters`   
`inspectorgadget.tool1`   
  
When you create an array, the computer numbers it, so to call avengers fav.character[2] would return "baby groot"
    
A function inside an object is a **method**   
  
**CURD operations** Creating, Updating, Reading and Deleting = the 4 things we do   
  
**see Starwars coding in Discord for this class and also screenshot 3**
