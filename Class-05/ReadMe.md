**WebP** 

WebPis an image file format developed by Google intended as a replacement for JPEG, PNG, and GIF file formats and the format is now compatible with web browsers beyond just Google products. It supports animation and alpha transparency and also both lossy and lossless compression - this means you can either compress images without losing data or with losing only some non-essential information. Google’s developers have suggested that lossless WebP images can be up to 26% smaller than PNGs.

WebP images are generally quicker to view in browsers rather than built-in photo applications

Google created the WebP file format to make online images less bulky. With significantly reduced photo and graphic sizes, websites load faster and give users a better experience as it encourages web developers and designers to first convert PNG and JPEG files to WebP to speed up page loading times.
